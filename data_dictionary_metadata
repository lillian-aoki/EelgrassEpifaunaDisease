The dataset and code used here support the manuscript titled "Seagrass wasting disease risk and intensity increase with invertebrate grazing across the northeastern Pacific". A link will be provided upon publication.

Much of the dataset is derived from the datasets available on BCO-DMO here: https://www.bco-dmo.org/project/776011
The project includes ecological surveys of eelgrass wasting disease for 3 years. 

Sea Surface Temperatures used in this analysis were derived from the MUR and G1SST products, available on the NASA PODAAC site, https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Detailed information on the collection of the dataset is available in the related manuscript and in the project handbook archived on BCO-DMO (https://datadocs.bco-dmo.org/docs/305/Eelgrass_disease/data_docs/eelgrass_disease_project_handbook_v1.2.pdf)

DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

Code file 01_data_prep.R takes in data files and aggregates for this analysis. 
Input datasets are:
2021_lesion_qPCR_conservative_results.csv - a file with results of pathogen load analysis from eelgrass tissue samples
combined_site_metadata.csv - a file with site locations and other metadata for the eelgrass surveys
combined_transect_survey_metrics.csv - a file with shoot metrics and disease data from the eelgrass surveys, aggregated at the level of transects (six 20-m transects within each site)
EGWD_transect_data_v20230307_big_epi_with_BB_transect.csv - a file with compiled epifauna abundances from eelgrass surveys
grazing_scars_compiled.csv - a file with aggregated data on grazing scar presence from eelgrass survey samples
meter_level_shoot_metrics_with_diseaes.csv - a file with shoot morphology and diseae metrics for individual eelgrass shoots sampled during surveys (5 shoots per transect, 30 shoots per site) 
monthly_mean_temps_mur_g1sst_9y_sites.csv - a file with compiled 1-km, gridded SST records from intertidal eelgrass sites combining nine years of SST records to calculate daily mean temperatures per month
monthly_temp_anomlay_g1sst_9y_sites.csv - a file with temperature anomalies for reach month calculated relative to the 9-year climatological record for sites available in the G1SST product
monthly_temp_anomaly_mur_9y_sites.csv - a file with temperature anomalies for reach month calculated relative to the 9-year climatological record for sites available in the MUR product
Note, see the related repository, https://github.com/lillian-aoki/mur-sst-2019 for details on aggregating the SST data. 

Output datasets are: 
epifauna_for_region_specific_models_no_epiphytes.csv
epifauna_site_for_plotting.csv
epifauna_SEM_data_all_large.csv
Variable lists for the output datasets are in the DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION below

Code file 02_supplemental_figures.R provides code to create several supplemental figures for the manuscript. 

Code file 03_meadow_scale_SEM.R provides code to analyze the dataset using picewise structural equation models; this analysis is conducted on two years of data out of the three year dataset due to data limitations, see Table S1. 

Code file 04_partial_effect_plots.R provides code to produce partial effect plots to visualize effects found in the SEMs. 

Code file 05_leaf_level_SEM.R provides code to run a simplified SEM that tests the direction of the relationship between grazing scar presence and disease metrics of prevalence and lesion area. 

Code file 06_full_dataset_regression.R provides code to run a regression analysis on the full dataset (three years of data) to compare relative importance of different epifauna taxa on disease metrics and to confirm that the full dataset supports the findings of the SEM using 2 years of data. 

Code file helpers.R and coefs.R are from the piecewiseSEM package (available on github: http://jslefche.github.io/piecewiseSEM/). This analysis was conducted with piecewiseSEM version 2.1.0; however the developer versions of these files were required to calculate standardized coefficients for GLMMs. This issue is likely superseded in new versions of the package but for continuity the scripts are included here.

Code files can be run independently; however, outputs of 01_data_prep are required to run the subsequent files.
